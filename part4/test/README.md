Here’s a breakdown of the code:

- `describe` is a function that groups a series of tests together. In this case, it’s describing a test suite for the  `numberOfLikes` function.
- `test` is a function that defines a single test case. The test case is named “should correctly calculate the total likes of an array of `blogs`”.
- The test case uses the expect function from the `assert` library to assert that the result of calling `numberOfLikes` with the blogs array is equal to `30` for this test case.
